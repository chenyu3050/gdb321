Make sure that the local gdb has been installed before using it!<br>
Because pwndbg needs some dependencies: such as pyelftools, etc., it is best to install pwntools before installation. The command is as follows: pip install pwntools -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

`./run_gdb.sh remove`
